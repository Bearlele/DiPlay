# DiPlay

**CarPlay for compatible BYD Android head units.** Wired and wireless, with the familiar DiAuto interface. Independent app: `com.shihab.diplay`.

> **BYD support scope:** These projects focus on BYD cars. They may work on other brands, but other brands are unsupported and there are no plans to add support or fix brand-specific incompatibilities.

## 0.2.8 — public preview

Install on the **car**, not the iPhone. No jailbreak, dongle, Mac, account or authentication server is required for use. Core CarPlay does not require ADB; optional dashboard, battery, wheel-speed and parked-video features do. Your head unit must permit APK installation. The Android 8.0+ (API 26) compatibility port is experimental and needs testing on the target unit. It offers the existing car hotspot and a legacy Wi-Fi Direct path; the latter needs a readable driver frequency. Wireless CarPlay video and audio were confirmed by the user on a physical Android 8.0 phone. Wired use and the target head unit still need verification.

- Wired USB and wireless CarPlay with local authentication.
- BYD HUD navigation with arrows, distance and street names on verified firmware.
- Car hotspot support, improved audio buffering and saved receive diagnostics.
- Automatic address discovery, fixed-channel Wi-Fi fallbacks and successful-configuration memory.
- Icon/text size, resolution and frame rate; applying a display change reconnects CarPlay.
- Local diagnostic export. Reports are sent only if you choose to share them.
- Separate installation alongside DiAuto. Run one projection app at a time.

This is **not an Apple-certified product**. The APK bundles an experimental accessory identity recovered from public Carlinkit firmware, not a newly provisioned MFi identity for DiPlay. A bundled private key is extractable. Acceptance after future iOS updates, reliability across head units and suitability of that identity for general distribution are unresolved. This release invites community testing; it is not a guarantee of universal compatibility.

Earlier releases were tested on the development DiLink5.1 car: live windshield guidance and street names work, Car hotspot now starts CarPlay, and Wi-Fi Direct performance is substantially improved. Occasional audio cutouts remain and are deferred to a later update. The new features were tested on a BYD Tang with DiLink 5.0 and an iPhone 15 Pro on iOS 27; wheel-speed dead reckoning in tunnels remains unverified. Broader head-unit and iOS compatibility is not guaranteed. The HUD firmware scope and cleanup limits are documented in [BYD navigation](docs/BYD_NAVIGATION.md).

## What’s new in 0.2.8

- App interface in English, Simplified Chinese, Arabic, Russian and Spanish; synchronized Android app-language settings.
- Steering-wheel media controls and long-press Siri on supported BYD firmware while CarPlay is on screen.
- Dashboard display choices: map, turn card, or both; corrected dashboard keyframe recovery.
- Optional ADB feature on supported DiLink 5.0: pause the dashboard map stream when its display mode hides the map.
- Optional ADB battery reporting for Apple Maps, with warning threshold, charging-connector selection and a checked reconnect action.
- Wireless location reporting continues across the Bluetooth-to-Wi-Fi handoff; USB and wireless updates are limited to one per second.
- Optional ADB wheel-speed and gear reporting lets iPhone navigation estimate movement when GPS is unavailable. Tunnel use still needs validation.
- Optional iOS 27 video playback on the car screen while parked, with iPhone, touchscreen and steering-wheel controls. Playback closes when the car leaves P.
- DRM-protected video such as Apple TV+ is not supported; DiPlay is not a licensed FairPlay receiver. Netflix does not support AirPlay.

## Android 8 compatibility work in this branch (unreleased)

These source changes are not part of the published 0.2.8 APK:

- Lower the Android app minimum to Android 8.0 (API 26) and retain a legacy Wi-Fi Direct connection path. The actual Wi-Fi band is selected by the head-unit firmware and depends on its driver.
- Wireless CarPlay video and audio were confirmed on a physical Xiaomi Mi 6 running Android 8.0. The target Android 8.1 head unit and wired CarPlay still need testing.
- Add a 0 ms music-buffer option that starts on the first decoded audio chunk, alongside 300, 500 and 1000 ms. Zero means no extra prebuffer; it cannot remove decoder or hardware latency and may stutter on an unstable link.
- Add a setting to stop forwarding head-unit touchscreen events to the iPhone while keeping CarPlay video and audio available.
- Allow screen-size-triggered reconnects more time to close the previous wireless stack and release its Wi-Fi Direct group.

This repository starts with a clean public source snapshot. Local research, tester reports and release-signing secrets are excluded. The complete source corresponding to the APK is provided with every release; experimental runtime identity assets are described separately in the build instructions and notices.

## Local release packaging

The release APK intentionally contains the experimental accessory identity. The Git repository and source archive exclude all accessory and Android signing keys; tests generate synthetic identities at runtime. Source/CI builds omit runtime identity assets by default. Local release builds explicitly select an external asset directory. Publishing the APK makes its bundled identity extractable; building locally does not preserve that identity's confidentiality.
